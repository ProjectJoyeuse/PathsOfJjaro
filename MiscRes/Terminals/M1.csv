ARRIVAL_1_2,"***INCOMING MESSAGE FROM LEELA***

Welcome to the Marathon.  I am Leela, one of the two surviving
Artificial Intelligences aboard the Marathon.  I have been
severely damaged, and am working to understand the current
situation.

Find the teleport terminal located in the Hangar's control
room.  By that time, I should have a better idea of what is
going on.
